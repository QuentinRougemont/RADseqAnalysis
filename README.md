# RADseqAnalysis
This repo (STILL IN CONSTRUCTION) contains most major script to perform RADseq Analysis as described in Rougemont et al. 2016.
Some update still needs to be done and I hope to find some time to add more scripts for pop. gen analysis in addition to script 
for RADseq genotyping and filtering. 
As some scripts may be missing do not hesitate to contact me at: quentinrougemont@orange.fr
